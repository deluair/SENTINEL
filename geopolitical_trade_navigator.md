# **SENTINEL**
## Fortune 500 Geopolitical Trade Risk Navigator - Comprehensive GitHub Simulation Project

### **Executive Summary**
Develop a sophisticated, real-time geopolitical trade risk assessment platform that quantifies supply chain vulnerabilities for Fortune 500 companies. Based on recent research showing up to $1 trillion in economic damages from geopolitical instability, with over 481 companies in the S&P 500 directly linked to high-risk regions, this system addresses the critical need for proactive risk intelligence in an era where widespread geopolitical unrest has thrown us into an era of unprecedented supply chain risk.

### **Real-World Problem Context**
Fortune 500 CEOs face mounting pressure as CEOs believe intensified trade wars will be the most significant conflict-related geopolitical business risk in 2025. Current challenges include:

- **Trade War Escalation**: average spot rates spiked more than 70% on critical trade from China to the US West Coast during previous tariff implementations
- **Supply Chain Opacity**: businesses only understand and monitor 2% of their supply chain, leaving them exposed to turmoil across the other 98%
